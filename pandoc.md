Right, so. Something everyone uses in daily life is some sort of office suite.
For most purposes, its usually word editing. A lot of people who use an open
source operating system such as Debian or Ubuntu tend to use Google Docs or
Libre Office. I don't personally feel like those fit the flow I had gotten used
to on Linux though.

A few months ago I had learned about something called [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
a way of turning plain text into html. I really fell in love with it for some
reason over a few of the other options. I've heard about things like Textile and
whatnot, but I went with Markdown for my daily use. Its better document, more 
supported, and it works with a wonderful program known as [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

Pandoc is a tool that can convert a lot of file types to other file types. The 
most common use I have for it is converting markdown to latex or markdown to
pdf. More-so the markdown to pdf option. 

The nice thing about Pandoc, is that it also is highly supported. I don't like
to use bloated programs. I prefer to stay as close to the command line as
possible. Linux is built around the idea that you'd be using it. So, because of 
that I use Vim to edit my markdown files, which amazingly has a rather nice
[pandoc plugin](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc).

So, pretty much all of my file editing is done through Pandoc and Vim. Even this
blog is being written in markdown using [dropplets](http://dropplets.com/).
Its easy to learn, its got like five hundred different versions, and like I said
its a lot closer to the ideal Linux experience in my opinion.
