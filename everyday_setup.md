So, the best way to get you up to speed would probably be just to talk about it.
My home setup is an Asus K53U. This thing isn't the prettiest, it has a Core 2
Duo processor, and an integrated graphics card. It cost my dad about four
hundred bucks and I love it. It isn't fast, it isn't pretty, and it isn't
powerful. And thats why I use Debian Unstable 7.0 on it.

My current desktop manager is XFCE4, I don't quite recall exactly which version
off the top of my head exactly. My main terminal emulator is Guake. The theme
I'm running on it is I believe some weird smashing of like, Numix, Pelle, and
a little bit of FlatStudio. There might be some Buoanotte in it too. I think
this is kinda just something that happens to you over time when you use linux.
I also managed to change my mouse to something thats just ridiculous and so 
nineties that its wonderful.

In lieu of a word processor, I tend to use things like Pandoc, Vim, and a 
myriad of other programs that most people don't use on other operating systems
due to being so command line intensive. Which reminds me, I usually spend more
time in my command line than on the actual desktop part. Its part of the reason
that I had installed Guake in the first place, since its so easy to push in and
out of the way. The reason for this is that I'm usually ssh'd into my vps using
mosh and all thats running on its tmux is irssi and tinyfugue, my mud client.

That covers about roughly all my everday stuff, save for some sometimes things
that don't really cross my mind too easily like skype, pidgin, and vlc.
